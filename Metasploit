You can start using Metasploit tool using the command:  msfcontrol
*use the nmap aggresive sthealth scan over the ports in an system and find the open port and vuknarabilities inside that system.
*later search for the vulnarability in the metasploit with the search : search <vulnarability>

*After getting the vulnarability name and version ,to start exploit use the command, syntax: use <vulnarability name>
*Now,metasploit will show the options over which we have to insert values , fill it and use the command "exploit" to gain access to the console through that specified port.

*Normal day to day linux commands are supported by the Metasploit,example for such commands are:
      1)ls
      2)ping
      3)clear
      4)help- the keyword help followed by the command name will show the proper syntax of that particular command.
